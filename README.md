# LSTM-Time-Series-Prediction
 A Simple LSTM-Based Solution for "Heartbeat Signal Classification and Prediction" in Tianchi Contest.

 I implemented this "Time Series Prediction" task in a single day using LSTM. Fortunately, such a simple solution reaches 1748 score in the contest. It is worth noting that a more advanced model, e.g. BERT and CNN-LSTM, may have a better performance in this task, so LSTM has much room for improvement. In this solution, I demonstrate my usual ML/DL framework and some training tricks.
 
 Thanks Tianchi for providing such a high-quality platform for ML competitions. Since it's helpful to practice the programming here, and I would update some of my solutions in the future.
